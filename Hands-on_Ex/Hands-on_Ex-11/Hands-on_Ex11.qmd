## **14.1 Overview**

Predictive modelling uses statistical learning or machine learning techniques to predict outcomes. By and large, the event one wants to predict is in the future. However, a set of known outcome and predictors (also known as variables) will be used to calibrate the predictive models.

Geospatial predictive modelling is conceptually rooted in the principle that the occurrences of events being modeled are limited in distribution. When geographically referenced data are used, occurrences of events are neither uniform nor random in distribution over space. There are geospatial factors (infrastructure, sociocultural, topographic, etc.) that constrain and influence where the locations of events occur. Geospatial predictive modeling attempts to describe those constraints and influences by spatially correlating occurrences of historical geospatial locations with environmental factors that represent those constraints and influences.

### **14.1.1 Learning outcome**

In this in-class exercise, you will learn how to build predictive model by using geographical random forest method. By the end of this hands-on exercise, you will acquire the skills of:

-   preparing training and test data sets by using appropriate data sampling methods,

-   calibrating predictive models by using both geospatial statistical learning and machine learning methods,

-   comparing and selecting the best model for predicting the future outcome,

-   predicting the future outcomes by using the best model calibrated.

## **14.3 Installing and Loading R packages**

This code chunk performs 3 tasks:

-   A list called packages will be created and will consists of all the R packages required to accomplish this exercise.

-   Check if R packages on package have been installed in R and if not, they will be installed.

-   After all the R packages have been installed, they will be loaded.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, spdep, GWmodel, SpatialML, 
               tmap, rsample, Metrics, tidyverse)
```

## **14.4 Preparing Data**

### **14.4.1 Reading data file to rds**

Reading the input data sets. It is in simple feature data frame.

```{r}
mdata <- read_rds("../../data/aspatial/mdata.rds")
```

### **14.4.2 Data Sampling**

The entire data are split into training and test data sets with 65% and 35% respectively by using *initial_split()* of **rsample** package. rsample is one of the package of tigymodels.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
resale_split <- initial_split(mdata, 
                              prop = 6.5/10,)
train_data <- training(resale_split)
test_data <- testing(resale_split)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(train_data, "../../data/aspatial/train_data.rds")
write_rds(test_data, "../../data/aspatial/test_data.rds")
```

## **14.5 Computing Correlation Matrix**

Before loading the predictors into a predictive model, it is always a good practice to use correlation matrix to examine if there is sign of multicolinearity.

```{r}
mdata_nogeo <- mdata %>%
  st_drop_geometry()
corrplot::corrplot(cor(mdata_nogeo[, 2:17]), 
                   diag = FALSE, 
                   order = "AOE",
                   tl.pos = "td", 
                   tl.cex = 0.5, 
                   method = "number", 
                   type = "upper")
```

## **14.6 Retriving the Stored Data**

```{r}
train_data <- read_rds("../../data/aspatial/train_data.rds")
test_data <- read_rds("../../data/aspatial/test_data.rds")
```

## **14.7 Building a non-spatial multiple linear regression**

```{r}
price_mlr <- lm(resale_price ~ floor_area_sqm +
                  storey_order + remaining_lease_mths +
                  PROX_CBD + PROX_ELDERLYCARE + PROX_HAWKER +
                  PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + PROX_MALL + 
                  PROX_SUPERMARKET + WITHIN_350M_KINDERGARTEN +
                  WITHIN_350M_CHILDCARE + WITHIN_350M_BUS +
                  WITHIN_1KM_PRISCH,
                data=train_data)
summary(price_mlr)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(price_mlr, "../../data/aspatial/price_mlr.rds" ) 
```

## **14.8 gwr predictive method**

In this section, you will learn how to calibrate a model to predict HDB resale price by using geographically weighted regression method of [**GWmodel**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GWmodel/) package.

### **14.8.1 Converting the sf data.frame to SpatialPointDataFrame**

```{r}
train_data_sp <- as_Spatial(train_data)
train_data_sp
```

### **14.8.2 Computing adaptive bandwidth**

Next, `bw.gwr()` of **GWmodel** package will be used to determine the optimal bandwidth to be used.

```{r}
#| eval: false
bw_adaptive <- bw.gwr(resale_price ~ floor_area_sqm +
                  storey_order + remaining_lease_mths +
                  PROX_CBD + PROX_ELDERLYCARE + PROX_HAWKER +
                  PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + PROX_MALL + 
                  PROX_SUPERMARKET + WITHIN_350M_KINDERGARTEN +
                  WITHIN_350M_CHILDCARE + WITHIN_350M_BUS +
                  WITHIN_1KM_PRISCH,
                  data=train_data_sp,
                  approach="CV",
                  kernel="gaussian",
                  adaptive=TRUE,
                  longlat=FALSE)
```

The result shows that 40 neighbour points will be the optimal bandwidth to be used if adaptive bandwidth is used for this data set.

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(bw_adaptive, "../../data/aspatial/bw_adaptive.rds")
```

### **14.8.3 Constructing the adaptive bandwidth gwr model**

First, let us call the save bandwidth by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
bw_adaptive <- read_rds("../../data/aspatial/bw_adaptive.rds")
```

Now, we can go ahead to calibrate the gwr-based hedonic pricing model by using adaptive bandwidth and Gaussian kernel as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
#| eval: false
gwr_adaptive <- gwr.basic(formula = resale_price ~
                            floor_area_sqm + storey_order +
                            remaining_lease_mths + PROX_CBD + 
                            PROX_ELDERLYCARE + PROX_HAWKER +
                            PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + PROX_MALL + 
                            PROX_SUPERMARKET + WITHIN_350M_KINDERGARTEN +
                            WITHIN_350M_CHILDCARE + WITHIN_350M_BUS +
                            WITHIN_1KM_PRISCH,
                          data=train_data_sp,
                          bw=bw_adaptive, 
                          kernel = 'gaussian', 
                          adaptive=TRUE,
                          longlat = FALSE)
```

The code chunk below will be used to save the model in rds format for future use.

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(gwr_adaptive, "../../data/aspatial/gwr_adaptive.rds")
```

### **14.8.4 Retrieve gwr output object**

The code chunk below will be used to retrieve the save gwr model object.

```{r}
gwr_adaptive <- read_rds("../../data/aspatial/gwr_adaptive.rds")
```

The code below can be used to display the model output.

```{r}
gwr_adaptive
```

### **14.8.5 Converting the test data from sf data.frame to SpatialPointDataFrame**

```{r}
test_data_sp <- test_data %>%
  as_Spatial()
test_data_sp
```

### **14.8.6 Computing adaptive bandwidth for the test data**

```{r}
#| eval: false
gwr_bw_test_adaptive <- bw.gwr(resale_price ~ floor_area_sqm +
                  storey_order + remaining_lease_mths +
                  PROX_CBD + PROX_ELDERLYCARE + PROX_HAWKER +
                  PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + PROX_MALL + 
                  PROX_SUPERMARKET + WITHIN_350M_KINDERGARTEN +
                  WITHIN_350M_CHILDCARE + WITHIN_350M_BUS +
                  WITHIN_1KM_PRISCH,
                  data=test_data_sp,
                  approach="CV",
                  kernel="gaussian",
                  adaptive=TRUE,
                  longlat=FALSE)
```

### **14.8.7 Computing predicted values of the test data**

```{r}
#| eval: false
gwr_pred <- gwr.predict(formula = resale_price ~
                          floor_area_sqm + storey_order +
                          remaining_lease_mths + PROX_CBD + 
                          PROX_ELDERLYCARE + PROX_HAWKER + 
                          PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + PROX_MALL + 
                          PROX_SUPERMARKET + WITHIN_350M_KINDERGARTEN +
                          WITHIN_350M_CHILDCARE + WITHIN_350M_BUS + 
                          WITHIN_1KM_PRISCH, 
                        data=train_data_sp, 
                        predictdata = test_data_sp, 
                        bw=40, 
                        kernel = 'gaussian', 
                        adaptive=TRUE, 
                        longlat = FALSE)

```{r}
coords <- st_coordinates(mdata)
coords_train <- st_coordinates(train_data)
coords_test <- st_coordinates(test_data)
```

Before continue, we write all the output into rds for future used.

```{r}
#| eval: false
coords_train <- write_rds(coords_train, "../../data/aspatial/coords_train.rds" )
coords_test <- write_rds(coords_test, "../../data/aspatial/coords_test.rds" )
```

### **14.9.2 Droping geometry field**

First, we will drop geometry column of the sf data.frame by using `st_drop_geometry()` of sf package.

```{r}
train_data <- train_data %>% 
  st_drop_geometry()
```

## **14.10 Calibrating Random Forest Model**

In this section, you will learn how to calibrate a model to predict HDB resale price by using random forest function of [**ranger**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ranger/) package.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
rf <- ranger(resale_price ~ floor_area_sqm + storey_order + 
               remaining_lease_mths + PROX_CBD + PROX_ELDERLYCARE + 
               PROX_HAWKER + PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + PROX_MALL + 
               PROX_SUPERMARKET + WITHIN_350M_KINDERGARTEN +
               WITHIN_350M_CHILDCARE + WITHIN_350M_BUS + 
               WITHIN_1KM_PRISCH,
             data=train_data)
rf
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(rf, "../../data/aspatial/rf.rds")
```

```{r}
rf <- read_rds("../../data/aspatial/rf.rds")
rf
```

## **14.11 Calibrating Geographical Random Forest Model**

In this section, you will learn how to calibrate a model to predict HDB resale price by using `grf()` of [**SpatialML**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ranger/) package.

### **14.11.1 Calibrating using training data**

The code chunk below calibrate a geographic ranform forest model by using `grf()` of **SpatialML** package.

```{r}
coords_train <- read_rds("../../data/aspatial/coords_train.rds")
coords_test <- read_rds("../../data/aspatial/coords_test.rds")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
set.seed(1234)
gwRF_adaptive <- grf(formula = resale_price ~ floor_area_sqm + storey_order +
                       remaining_lease_mths + PROX_CBD + PROX_ELDERLYCARE +
                       PROX_HAWKER + PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + PROX_MALL +
                       PROX_SUPERMARKET + WITHIN_350M_KINDERGARTEN +
                       WITHIN_350M_CHILDCARE + WITHIN_350M_BUS +
                       WITHIN_1KM_PRISCH,
                     dframe=train_data, 
                     bw=55,
                     kernel="adaptive",
                     coords=coords_train)
```

Let’s save the model output by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(gwRF_adaptive, "../../data/aspatial/gwRF_adaptive.rds")
```

The code chunk below can be used to retrieve the save model in future.

```{r}
#| eval: false
gwRF_adaptive <- read_rds("../../data/aspatial/gwRF_adaptive.rds")
```

### **14.11.2 Predicting by using test data**

#### 14.11.2.1 Preparing the test data

The code chunk below will be used to combine the test data with its corresponding coordinates data.

```{r}
#| eval: false
test_data <- cbind(test_data, coords_test) %>%
  st_drop_geometry()
```

#### 14.11.2.2 Predicting with test data

Next, `predict.grf()` of spatialML package will be used to predict the resale value by using the test data and gwRF_adaptive model calibrated earlier.

```{r}
#| eval: false
gwRF_pred <- predict.grf(gwRF_adaptive, 
                           test_data, 
                           x.var.name="X",
                           y.var.name="Y", 
                           local.w=1,
                           global.w=0)
```

Before moving on, let us save the output into rds file for future use.

```{r}
#| eval: false
GRF_pred <- write_rds(gwRF_pred, "../../data/aspatial/GRF_pred.rds")
```
